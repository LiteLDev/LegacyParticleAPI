# LegacyParticleAPI

## Usage

ParticleAPI provides a rich and easy-to-use particle generation interface for plugin development, which intuitive design and efficient and stable performance support developers to write better plugins.

Including headfile `#include "LegacyParticleAPI/ParticleAPI.h"` is the first step to use ParticleAPIã€‚
It provides the generation class `ParticleAPI` which is closer to the bottom layer and the further encapsulated CUI class `ParticleCUI`. The difference between the two is very small, and only the members of the CUI class are introduced here.
